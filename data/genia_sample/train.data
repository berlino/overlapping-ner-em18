Whereas activation of the HIV - 1 enhancer following T - cell stimulation is mediated largely through binding of the transcription factor NF - kappa B to two adjacent kappa B sites in the HIV - 1 long terminal repeat , activation of the HIV - 2 enhancer in monocytes and T cells is dependent on four cis - acting elements : a single kappa B site , two purine - rich binding sites , PuB1 and PuB2 , and a pets site .
