The affinity of the BAT box binding proteins for the BAT box was approximately 25 - fold less than for the octamer sequence and the BAT box binding proteins dissociated from the BAT box 10 - fold more rapidly than from the octamer sequence .

Despite this lower affinity , a trimer of the BAT box sequence was as efficiently transactivated by an Oct - 2 expression vector as was a trimer of the octamer sequence in HeLa cells .

The induction of CD20 mRNA was temporally associated with induction of Oct - 2 mRNA and a BAT box - deleted CD20 - CAT construct , in contrast to the wild type , was poorly induced by phorbol esters .

Together these results suggest that the BAT box binding proteins are important in the B cell specific expression of CD20 and perhaps CD21 .
